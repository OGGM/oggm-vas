OGGM compatible, python implementation of the [Marzeion et al. (2012)]()
model.

About
-----

[OGGM-VAS](https://github.com/OGGM/oggm-vas) is a python re-implementation of the
well known [Marzeion et al., 2012](https://tc.copernicus.org/articles/6/1295/2012/) model,
based on Volume Area Scaling (hence the name).

This re-implementation is strictly equivalent to the original 2012 model, but adopts "the OGGM workflow".
This means that both models now also agree on the boundary conditions and climate data. OGGM-VAS has 
been developed primarily by [Moritz Oberrauch](https://github.com/oberrauch).
